## Genre Prediction Project

This is a project I completed for my Spring 2020 Statistical Learning class at Middlebury College. 
In it, I built a kNN algorithm that used a variety of musical varaibles to predict the genre of a specific song. 
This repository includes a datasets directory that holds the Kaggle sourced datasets used, an R markdown file 
with my code, and a knitted html file in the docs directory which can be viewed [here](https://dangause.github.io/genre_prediction_project/).
